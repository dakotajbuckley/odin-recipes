        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No need to buy premade batter anymore when making your own is this easy!</p>
        <p>You just need to mix the dry ingredients, then mix the wet ingredients, mix them together just before cooking
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs,
                and
                melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface
                and
                if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended
                together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook
                until
                bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other
                side.
                Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
